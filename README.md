# Swift-Meetup

This is a Xcode project that I used to demo various UI Layout techniques during the Swift Louisville Meetup.  

Topics include:
- Center a label
- Add features to Xcode to set a buttons corner radius, border width and border color
- How to use referenced storyboards, to break up large projects
- Set autolayout constraints programatically
- Set TableView Cells to respond to changes in dynamic text sizes.  Older eyes will really like this one.
- Use trait varying to set a different font size for label on iPhone vs. iPad
- Using StackViews for laying out interface
- Using autolayout to set a "perctage" away from an object.  This one will allow you to set 30% on each side.  It was very useful for making a game I have work on iPad and iPhone.  It allowed objects to grow and shrink depending on device. 
- Change button layout from vertical to horizontal based on portrait or landscape orientation.

NOTE: The project has several View Controllers, each one with a single topic.  I also added notes in the storyboard to help explain each topic. To run each demo on device/simulator simply select the View Controller and click the "Is Initial View Controller"
