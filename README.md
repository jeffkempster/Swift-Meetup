# Swift-Meetup

This is a Xcode project that I used to demo various UI Layout techniques during the Swift Louisville Meetup.  

Topics include
- Center a label
- Add features to Xcode to set a buttons corner radius, border width and border color
- How to use referenced storyboards, to break up large projects
- Set autolayout constraints programatically
- Set TableView Cells to respond to changes in dynamic text sizes.  Older eyes will really like tihs one.
- Use trait varying to set a different font size for label on iPhone vs. iPad
- 


NOTE: The project has several View Controllers, each one with a single topic.  I also added notes in the storyboard to help explain each topic. To run each demo on device/simulator simply select the View Controller and click the "Is Initial View Controller"
