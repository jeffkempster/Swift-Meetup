# Swift Louisville Meetup

## Description
This is a Xcode project that I used to demo various UI Layout techniques during the Swift Louisville Meetup.  

## Topics
- Centering a label in a view
- Add features to Xcode to set a button's corner radius, border width and border color from interface builder
- How to use referenced storyboards, to break up large storyboards 
- Set autolayout constraints programatically
- Set TableView Cells to respond to changes in dynamic text sizes.  Older eyes ðŸ‘€ will really like this one.
- Use trait varying to set a different font size for label on iPhone vs. iPad
- Using StackViews for laying out an interface
- Using autolayout to set a "percentage" away from a view.  This one will allow you to set 30% on each side.  It was very useful for making a game work on iPad and iPhone.  It allowed objects to grow and shrink depending on device. 
- Change button layout from vertical to horizontal based on portrait or landscape orientation. Uses trait varying

**NOTE:** The project has several View Controllers, each one with a single topic.  I also added notes in the storyboard to help explain each topic. To run each demo on device/simulator simply select the View Controller and click the "Is Initial View Controller"
